## Pointlessly long preface

This project is referent to the [Project: Messaging App](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-messaging-app) of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com). The extra credits functionalities were also considered upon conception.

The planing phase was done, as per usual, in the form of scribbles on paper that can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dRjA_iEQCoZP_ebRtmJv015gIXpo0x7t?usp=sharing). Potentially there are even more documents there if I deemed necessary to add it, so I recommend you to check it out.

## Features to implement

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Modifiers ("not priority" and the like) don't imply importance. Most of the time they simply mean that I thought they were too difficult to tackle for now.
